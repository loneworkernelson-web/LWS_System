### **Introducing the Lone Worker Safety (LWS) System**

Ensure the safety of your community-based staff with our free, self-hosted Lone Worker Safety System.

Designed for non-profits, healthcare providers, and any organization with staff working alone in the field, this system provides a robust and reliable safety net without expensive monthly subscription fees. You host it yourself on your own Google account.

**How It Works:**

1. **Worker App (PWA for Smartphones):**

  * The worker installs a simple app on their phone.

  * Before a visit, they select a location, set a visit duration (e.g., 45 minutes), and tap "ON SITE".

  * A large countdown timer starts, locking the screen.

2. **Monitoring Dashboard (Web App):**

  * A designated safety monitor back at the office has a live dashboard showing all active workers.

  * They can see who is on-site, where they are, and when they are due to depart.

3. **Automated Alerts:**

  * If a worker's timer expires and they don't check in, the system automatically sends escalating email alerts to emergency contacts (e.g., at 15, 30, and 45 minutes overdue).

  * The monitor's dashboard flashes, and an audible alarm sounds.

**Core Safety Features:**

* **Panic Button (SOS):** A discreet triple-tap on the SOS button sends an *immediate* high-priority alert to the monitor and triggers an email.

* **Duress PIN:** Workers set a secondary "duress" PIN. If forced to shut down the app, entering this PIN makes the app *appear* to close normally but silently sends the highest-priority "DURESS" alert.

* **GPS Tracking:** The system captures a GPS location when an alert is triggered, providing a "last known location" link on Google Maps for the monitor.

* **Low Battery Warning:** The app notifies the monitor if the worker's phone battery is low at the start of a visit.

* **Manual Override:** The monitor can manually resolve an alert (with a two-step confirmation) once they have confirmed the worker is safe.
